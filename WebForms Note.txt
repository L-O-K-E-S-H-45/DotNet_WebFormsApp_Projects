.NET is language independent, which means you can use any .NET supported language to make .NET applications. The most common languages for writing ASP.NET applications are C# and VB.NET.

One of the main differences between ASP.NET and Classic ASP/PHP is the fact that ASP.NET is compiled, while Classic ASP is always interpreted.
ASP.NET was basically divided into ASP.NET Web Forms (the original approach) and ASP.NET MVC. 
ASP.NET can be used without an IDE(Integrated Development Environment). It would be perfectly possible to write ASP.NET code in Notepad, and use the commandline compiler included with the .NET framework.
if you want to develop ASP.NET Web Forms websites, you will have to use the regular (non-Core) version of the .NET framework and likely have your website hosted on a Windows Server.
